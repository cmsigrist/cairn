    `There was an explosion, and you lost your sense of smell. Well, almost:
you can sniff out gold as a pig does truffles. Take a Tin of Snuff (6 uses) to
dampen the impact. Use it every day or become deprived.`,
    `You dematerialized a beloved pet. Now it follows you around, invisible
but always present. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm,
you are able to share its senses (add a Fatigue each time). It follows basic
commands.`,
    `You were exposed to a long-acting truth serum whose effects have yet to
wear off. The disorder has its advantages: you cannot repeat lies youâ€™ve
heard, either.`,
    `You were adept at creating fake gold, which is almost as good. Eventually,
your ruse was discovered and you had to make a hasty retreat. Take a
heavy Metal Ingot and Gold Powder (3 uses).`,
    `Your recipe worked, but a rival stole the blueprint before your claims
could be proven. Take a prototype Blunderbuss (d12, blast, bulky) that
takes one round to reload, and a taste for revenge.`,
    `Ridiculed for discovering how to turn gold into lead, you were a laughing
stock. Take a bottle of Universal Solvent (2 uses) that dissolves anything it
touches into its constituent parts.`,
